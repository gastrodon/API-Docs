# API-Docs

What is this?
=============

This is a collection of `.yml` files that describe how to use apis. These aren't regular apis though, they're private interfaces that apps like amino and iFunny use.
The docs were written based on logging api calls and observing how they behave.
For any app / service added to this repo, it will be inside it's own folder, usually with a file called `docs.yml`. Docs will also be included, usually `docs.md`

Docs in this repo are generated with a tool called [`persim`](https://github.com/gastrodon/persim) that I wrote. You can use it if you'd like, but I have not gotten around to writing a proper install script.
